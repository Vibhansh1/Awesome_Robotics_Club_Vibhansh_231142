The main reason for which I am trying to join this project of "SPACE STATION CONTROL AND COMMUNICATION OF ROBOTICS CLUB" is because I always wanted to get to know more about robotic technologies and the process through which data transmission and manipulation takes place . Also space exploration has always been a dream for me as it is also going to be the most fascinating field of view for human civilisation in the future and I want to learn about it in better ways.
